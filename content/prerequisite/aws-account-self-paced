__Note__: If you already have an AWS account with a role that has IAM Administrator permissions you can skip this step.

If you do not already have an AWS account with Administrator access: [create one now](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/).

Once you have created an AWS account, create a IAM user with administrator access to the AWS account (attach __AdministratorAccess__ Permissions policy). [Create a new IAM user for the workshop](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users$new).
