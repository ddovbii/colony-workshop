__Note__: If you already have an AWS account with a role that has IAM Administrator permissions you can skip this step.

1\. [Create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/).

2\. Once you have created an AWS account, [create a IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users$new) with administrator access to the AWS account (attach __AdministratorAccess__ Permissions policy).
